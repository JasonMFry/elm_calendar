# Elm Calendar

Welcome! This is a calendar app using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), a delightful, functional language
for reliable webapps. We're building this together with the entire group at [Frontend
Awesome!](https://www.meetup.com/Gainesville-Front-End-Dev-Meetup/), Gainesville's frontend meetup
group.

(Note that "we" is [@MainShayne233](https://github.com/MainShayne233) and
[@JasonMFry](https://github.com/JasonMFry).)

## Notes

We are going to mob this project together, and other than the introductory material we don't intend
to plan anything in advance. This is both because we're lazy, and because we think it'll provide a
better learning environment.
